                <h1>Martínez shootout heroics propel Argentina into Copa América final</h1>

                        <li>Argentina goalkeeper saves three penalties against Colombia</li>
                        <li>Win qualifies Messi’s side for Saturday’s final against Brazil</li>
                    </h4>
                    <img src="2065.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Emiliano Martínez was the hero for Argentina as he saved three times in a shootout to take his team into a Copa América final match-up with Brazil after Tuesday’s semi-final against Colombia finished 1-1 after 90 minutes.

                Martínez, who tried to distract Colombia’s players in the shootout with a barrage of trash talk, saved from Davinson Sanchez, Yerry Mina and Edwin Cardona.
                
                Lionel Messi, Leandro Paredes and Lautaro Martínez scored for Argentina as they booked a spot against the host nation in Saturday’s final at Rio de Janeiro’s Maracanã stadium.
                
                “I’m speechless,” said Argentine keeper Martínez. “They took us to penalties and that’s a question of luck, today it was my turn for glory.”
                
                Both sides had chances to win in an intense, end-to-end match punctuated by 46 fouls and 10 yellow cards.
                
                Argentina are seeking to win their first major international title since lifting the Copa América in 1993 and once again Lionel Messi was the star man, notching up his fifth assist of the tournament to add to his four goals.
                
                Taking a superb pass from Giovani Lo Celso after six minutes, Messi rolled the ball to Lautaro Martínez to fire home a low shot and give Argentina the lead. Colombia found their feet soon after and hit the woodwork twice in a minute towards the end of the first half when Wilmar Barrio’s deflected shot struck the post and then Mina watched his header hit the bar from the resulting corner.</p>
